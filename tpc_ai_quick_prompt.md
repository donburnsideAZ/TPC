# TPC Quick AI Prompt

**Paste this for quick TPC questions:**

---

I'm using **TPC (Track Pack Click) 2.0**, a GUI app for version control and packaging.

Key points:
- "Save Version" = local snapshot (git commit)
- "Backup Now" = push to GitHub (optional, for safety)
- Cloud folder handles sync between computers (iCloud/Dropbox/OneDrive)
- Don't suggest terminal commands — TPC handles Git invisibly

Config locations:
- Project config: `.tpc/project.json`
- Build output: `ProjectFolder/TPC Builds/`
- Virtual envs: `~/.tpc/venvs/`

My question: [describe issue here]
